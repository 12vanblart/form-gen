# Contributing

Welcome to Json 2 HTML!

If you're unsure of a change you'd like to make, feel free to discuss via issue, send me a message on [DEV](https://dev.to/tvanblargan) or [Tweet your idea at me](https://twitter.com/PichuPlayer)!

All Pull Requests will be reviewed in due time. I have other things going on, so sometimes it may take me a few days to review. Your patience is appreciated!

## Pull Request Guidelines

Not all Commits/Pull Requests are required to have an emoji in the front, but it would definitely make me smile to see one added!

Example Commits that I've 100% written at some point:

`😅 Forgot to remove extra Console.log()`
`✨ Made the form look prettier!!`
`🎉 Got the thing working!`
`🐛 Fixed bug with objects and arrays not being type checked`

And remember: _Haaaave fun with it!_
