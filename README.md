# json2html

Welcome to json2html! I was working on a project that required a bunch of forms for adding and editing records when I thought, "Hmm... wouldn't it be nice to be able to drop a sample JSON record into a field, click a button, and have the HTML spit out for me?"

And from there, json2html was created. Hopefully some of you will find this useful ðŸ˜„
